Reading this, would you be concerned about Russia interfering in the American midterm elections? While our opinions are certainly shaped by many different inputs, the news we consume can play a decisive role in this process. Especially major political events - such as elections - tend to increase the consumption of online websites ([Ray, 2023](#url3)) or social media ([Haugsgjerd & Karlsen, 2022](#url2)) as a source of political news. By consuming political news online, users often move within their own ecochambers - created by the types of news websites they visit and the users they interact with. 

While it would be ambitious to draw a causal link between the news sources people visit and the opinions they hold, the statements above beg the question: **Is a higher threat perception of Russia related to the type of news US citizens consume?**

To explore these patterns, this brief study uses data from the Media Exposure and Opinion Formation (MEOF) study ([Guess et al, 2022](#url1)), which contains a dataset of a multi-wave panel survey, investigating political and issue attitudes, behaviour, knowledge and online media consumption of US citizens. The MEOF study also contains a dataset on web visits and mobile app use of some of the survey participants. This study utilizes survey data on respondents' self-reported threat perception towards Russia and their online browsing behaviour in the same time period - namely, from October 30 to November 6, 2018, shortly before the US midterm elections. 

#### **Analysis:**

Asking US citizens whether they are concerned about Russia interfering in the American midterm elections shows that opinions on this issue are highly polarized.

32.4% of participants report to be 'extremely concerned' (high threat group), while 28.9% of participants report that they are 'not at all concerned' (low threat group) about Russian election interference. Analyzing the online browsing behaviour of respondents from both groups in the same time period might help to explore patterns and variations in online media consumption across people with differing threat perceptions. 

**Online Media Consumption**
In order to analyse the patterns of online news consumption within the high and low threat group, the domains that participants accessed were mapped to keywords like 'NYtimes' to identify only news websites within the browsing data. Domains that were accessed for less than thirty seconds were excluded from the analysis. Based on the total number of accesses, the most popular news websites could be identified across the high and low threat groups.

```{r, fig.show="hold", out.width="85%", fig.align="center", warning=F, echo=F}



```
<br>

A comparison of the most popular news websites across both groups reveals interesting observations. While FoxNews seems to be a frequently visited news source within both groups, the popularity of other news sources seemingly differs across groups. In the group of respondents who perceive Russian election interference as low threat, (source), (source), (source) are among the most frequently accessed news websites. In the group of respondents who are extremely concerned about Russian election interference, (source), (source), (source) rank among the most frequently accessed news websites.

**Political Leaning**
In order to get a better understanding of how news source consumption and threat perception might be related, the political leaning of media outlets is a relevant factor. The news websites accessed by members of the high and low threat groups were therefore grouped into categories based on the AllSides media bias chart.

#### **Future Thoughts:**

Certainly, it is not possible to infer from this exploratory study that threat perceptions and online media consumption influence one another. Yet, the results point to the pattern that US citizens with different threat perceptions of Russian election interference also consume different types of online media, at least on an aggregate level. Limitations in this study provide ideas to research this topic further. Specifically, future work should include additional variables to measure US citizens threat perception of Russia more precisely or include other issue areas too. Likewise, the measurement of the consumption level of web sources should be more granular, beyond the aggregate number of visits or total consumption duration per group. Moreover, using keywords such as 'NYTimes' to identify online news sources from the web browsing data can lead to inaccuracies, for example, by including domains that contain the keyword but are not the news source in question. This study implemented measures to avoid an incorrect selection of domains based on keyword, yet these errors cannot entirely be eliminated in the scope of this study (for further information, please read the code and accompanying explanation).
