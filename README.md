### Data 

This repository comprises data from a survey conducted in the United States in 2018:

Guess, Andrew M.; Barberá, Pablo; Yang, JungHwan; Munzert, Simon (2022): *Media Exposure and Opinion Formation in an Age of Information Overload (MEOF) – Survey U.S.A.* GESIS Data Archive, Cologne. ZA7895 Data file Version 1.0.0, [doi:10.4232/1.13980](https://doi.org/10.4232/1.13980).

In addition, it comprises associated passive browser tracking data, which is a subset of the data published here:

Munzert, Simon, Barberá, Pablo, Guess, Andrew M., & Yang, JungHwan (2022). *Media Exposure and Opinion Formation in an Age of Information Overload (MEOF) – Webtracking on-site.* GESIS, Cologne. ZA7896 Data file Version 1.0.0, [doi.org/10.4232/1.13981](https://doi.org/10.4232/1.13981).

### Description

The Media Exposure and Opinion Formation (MEOF) study is a multi-wave panel survey that was fielded between April 2018 and October 2019 in the United States. It was branded as “Politics & Media” survey ([doi:10.4232/1.13980](https://doi.org/10.4232/1.13980)). The survey makes it possible to investigate political attitudes and behaviors, knowledge, online media consumption, and various issue attitudes of US citizens. In addition to survey data, the panel used passive metering technology to collect real-time data on web visits and mobile app use (not part of this publication). A similar survey was fielded in Germany as “Politik & Medien” Survey between June 2017 and October 2019 (see ZA7894, [doi.org/10.4232/1.13979](http://dx.doi.org/10.4232/1.13979)).

### Statement of contributions

**Giorgio Coppola** completed task 1.1 and performed the analysis in task 2. The latter primarily included web data re-structuring, drafting tables and plots. Prior to that, he assisted in the coordination of the research question conceptualization and operationalization.

**Varvara Ilyina** completed task 1.2 and the preparation for the analysis in task 2. The latter primarily included the data operationalization and creating several histogram distribution plots of relevant variables. Prior to the coding of the variable preparation, she assisted in the coordination of the research question conceptualization. Finally, she took charge on final layout touchups and spelling checks of the report and code.

**Armande Aboudrar-Meda** completed task 1.3 and performed the analysis in task 2. The latter primarily included web data re-structuring, drafting tables and plots. She also assisted in the coordination of the research question conceptualization and operationalization.

**Luca Vellage** completed task 1.4 and took charge of coordinating the conceptualization and operationalization of task 2, prepared the report and helped debugging code in task 2.

**Giulia Petrilli** completed task 1.5 and contributed to the conceptualization of task 2, helped debugging the code and proofread the report.
